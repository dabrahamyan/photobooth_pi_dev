To-Do List:

Make pi run on its own
debug issue of a bunch of photos being printed at once
make separate QR codes for each print
create error handling for connection issues if me and lucas not there

Prioritize:
Make pi run on its own ------------
Error handling for if it cannot connect to wifi/hotspot
        (error handling doesn't work too well but thats ok were at least somewhere)
        and it seems like taking pictures works alright anyways
        this does not include troubleshooting for connection
        doesn't seem like it matters if it connects or not

debug issue of a bunch of photos being printed at once

make separate QR codes for each print

TO-DO tomorrow:
1. test whether it still works if wifi is fully off 
    then if so --> make version where there is no QR code section.
    This can be a branch off the main, just to switch to in case
    separate QR codes/ connection error handling is not made in time

2. Make separate QR code stuff
3. Make error handling for connection
